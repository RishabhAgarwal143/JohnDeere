This application can be used by Farmers to track and manage Farming tasks. It allows them to track their fields and their associated field operation tasks. Hence, it allows the farmers to visualize their famring progress and reflect on future changes well.

Programming Language Used: **Python**

Features of the Application:

Our application prompts the user to enter fields that they wish to create. Concurrently, field operations (pre-set) and new field operations can be entered. Once the user has created all the required fields and their field operators, the application moves on to field assignments.

Users can select the created fields and make corresponding field operator assignments by a drop-down menu. Users are also able to view past field assignments.

Users are also able to update the field names and field operators in the application, and delete unwanted field names and operators.

Human Errors can never be overlooked, particularly for a software like this. Hence, we have added a restore feature to our application, where users can restore deleted fields and field operations.
